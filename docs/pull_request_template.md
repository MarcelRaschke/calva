## My Calva PR Checklist
<!-- Remove the checkboxes that do not apply, as Github reports how many are not ticked. If you want to add checkboxes, please do. -->

I have:

- [ ] Read [How to Contribute](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/wiki/How-to-Contribute#before-sending-pull-requests).
- [ ] Directed this pull request at the `dev` branch. (Or have specific reasons to target some other branch.)
- [ ] Made sure I have changed the default PR base branch, so that it is not `master`. (Sorry for the nagging.)
- [ ] Updated the `[Unreleased]` entry in `CHANGELOG.md`, linking the issue(s) that the PR is addressing.
- [ ] Figured if **anything** about the fix warrants tests on Mac/Linux/Windows/Remote/Whatever, and either tested it there if so, or mentioned it in the PR.
- [ ] Tested the VSIX built from the PR (so, after you've submitted the PR). You'll find the artifacts by clicking _Show all checks_ in the CI section of the PR page, and then _Details_ on the `ci/circleci: build` test. NB: *There is a CircleCI bug that makes the Artifacts hard to find. Please see [this issue](https://discuss.circleci.com/t/artifacts-tab-not-showing-unless-logged-in/32433) for workarounds.*
     - [ ] Tested the particular change
     - [ ] Figured if the change might have some side effects and tested those as well.
     - [ ] Smoke tested the extension as such.
- [ ] Referenced the issue I am fixing/addressing _in a commit message for the pull request_.
     - [ ] If I am fixing the issue, I have used [GitHub's fixes/closes syntax](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords)
     - [ ] If I am fixing just part of the issue, I have just referenced it w/o any of the "fixes‚Äù keywords.
- [ ] Created the issue I am fixing/addressing, if it was not present.
- [ ] Added to or updated docs in this branch, if appropriate

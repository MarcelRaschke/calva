# Refactoring

There are two ”flavours” to refactoring support. Some (just a few) refactorings are made available as _Quick Fix_ suggestions (the light bulb), the rest are regular commands in the *Calva Refactoring* category.

You can enable or disable the _Quick Fix_ suggestion lightbulb using the VS Code setting `editor.lightbulb.enabled`.

The refactoring commands do not have default keyboard shortcuts. You find them all by typing ”Calva Refactor” in the Command Palette.

!!! Note "Formatting"
    The way that some of the refactorings are applied to the document, makes it difficult for Calva to format the results. So, sometimes you'll need to navigate the cursor to the enclosing form and hit `tab` to tidy up the formatting after a refactoring. See also [Formatting](formatting.md).

## Thanks to clojure-lsp

Most of Calva's refactoring support is sourced directly from [clojure-lsp](clojure-lsp.md). This also means that most often, if you find issues with refactoring, or have suggestions about it, the clojure-lsp repo is where to direct your reporting.
